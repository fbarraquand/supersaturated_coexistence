abstract: "Huisman and Weissing (1999) propose to solve the paradox of plankton using a resource-based differential equations model demonstrating oscilations and chaos. Here we successfully reproduced their results and figures using R. We added two numerical experiments showing, however, that theses results are not robust to mild pertubations of the intrinsic growth rates."
